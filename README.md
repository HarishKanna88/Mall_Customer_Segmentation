Customer Segmentation Analysis using K-Means Clustering:

This project focuses on analyzing customer data to identify distinct segments using K-Means clustering. The process involves data preprocessing, clustering, and visualization using Streamlit for interactive exploration.

Steps:

**Data Preprocessing:

>Load the customer data from Mall_Customers.csv.
>Handle missing values and encode categorical variables if necessary.

**Feature Scaling:

>Standardize numerical features like annual income and spending score using StandardScaler from scikit-learn.

**Segmentation with K-Means:

>Apply K-Means clustering to identify clusters of customers based on their standardized features.
>Optimize the number of clusters using techniques like the elbow method or silhouette score.

**Visualization:

>Visualize clusters using scatter plots to explore relationships between features like annual income and spending score.
>Create additional plots to understand the distribution of customer attributes within each cluster.

**Streamlit App Development:

>Develop an interactive web application using Streamlit to showcase the segmentation analysis.
>Include components for displaying scatter plots and distribution plots dynamically based on user selections.
